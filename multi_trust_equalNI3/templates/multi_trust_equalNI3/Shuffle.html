        <p>
        <br>
            You have assigned the role of distributor for this group assignment<br>
            The following multilateral distribution rounds will be structured as follows:<br>

        <ol>
        <li>Each sender will begin the round with 100 points. They will each independently
            decide how many of the points to send to you.
            You also begin the round with 100 points. </li>
        <li>You will receive triple the summation of the points sent by each sender.
            For example, if each sender sends 2 points to you, you will receive 18 points. The summation of the
            sent points is 6 and 6x3 = 18. </li>
        <li>You will decide how much of your available points you would like to keep for yourself </li>
        <li>The remainder of the points will be split equally to each sender. For example,
            if the distributor keeps 3 points of the 18 points received, each sender is returned 5 points.</li>
        <li>All senders will be notified of the amount of points returned to them. They will also know how many points
            you kept. They will not know the amount of tokens returned to the other senders, nor the amount the other
            senders sent to you. </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
        <br>You have assigned the role of sender for this group assignment
        The following multilateral distribution rounds will be structured as follows:

        <ol>
        <li>Each sender, including yourself, will begin the round with 100 points. You will each independently
            decide how many of these points to send to the distributor.
            The distributor will also begin the round with 100 points. </li>

        <li>You will be asked to estimate how many points you expect will be returned to you by the distributor. </li>

        <li>The distributor will receive triple the sum of all of points sent by the senders. For example,
            if each sender allocates 2 points to the distributor, 6 total points were sent by the senders.
            This number is then tripled so the distributor will receive 18 points </li>

        <li>The distributor will decide how much of the allocated points to keep. The remainder of the points will be
            split equally. For example, if the distributor takes 3 points from the points received, 5
            points will be redistributed to each sender. </li>

        <li>All senders will be notified of the amount of points returned to them.
            If the sender's estimation is within 10 points of the actual returned amount of points
            they may receive 40 extra points for their payoff in that round.
        <ul>
            <li>You will know the amount of money kept by the distributor,  but you will not know the amount of points
            distributed to the other senders, nor the amount of points allocated to the distributor by the senders</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        Please note that each round is independent so points do not transfer between rounds.
